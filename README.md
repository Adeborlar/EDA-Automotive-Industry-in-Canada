The objective of this project is to carry out an analysis of the automotive industry in Canada. <br>

## Why this industry? <br>
• Auto manufacturing contributes over $16 billion to Canadian GDP. <br>
• Manufacturing sales of motor vehicles and parts were $74.2 billion in 2020. <br>
• Vehicles are the second largest Canadian export by value at $42.9 billion in 2020. <br>
• The Detroit-Windsor crossing represents the highest number of loaded truck container crossings annually. <br>
• Auto manufacturing accounts for 135,000 direct jobs in Canada. <br>
• For each one auto assembly job, approximately ten other jobs are created in upstream and downstream activities. <br>
• Canada is the 11th leading vehicle producer in the world. <br>
• Canada is dependent on exporting outside of its own borders. <br> <br>

## What do we want to do?
Investors are always looking for new business opportunities to increase their capital, expecting from their investment a high return with the probability of lower losses.<br><br>
Therefore, some of the investors in Canada see great potential in the vehicle industry. However, they need a better understanding of this industry, which allows them to have an overview of where to focus their investment. <br> <br>
Our Project group will create a descriptive analytical product to examine the historical behavior of vehicles sales in Canada, and in this way help investors gain insights about this industry, which can be useful to clarify the potential of this market and define if they decide to invest or not. <br> <br>

## What do we want to Analyze?
This first part of the project is just about exploring data from the different data sets. However, in the end the goal is to generate answers to the following questions: <br>
1. Which province/geographical region generates the highest revenue yearly? What is the province that sells the most cars per capita? 
2. Does the sale price by unit tend to be constant, or does it show significant variations from one year to the next, or from one province to another?
3. Does the season of the year influence car sales in Canada? In which season of the year are more vehicles sold? 
4. Is the price of imported vehicles from Japan or other countries competitive compared to the price of vehicles in North America? 
5. How many electric cars have been registered in Canada by province and by year.
6. Are those provinces that have a rebate policy the ones that sell the most electric cars per capita?
7. The value of the rebate offered by the provinces has an influence on the increase or decrease in the registration of electric cars. 
8. How the retail sale is distributed by province and by year according to dealer classification?
9. Which is the province that sells the most parts, accessories and tires per capita?
10. Which is the province with a faster / slower inventory turnover?
11. What is the behavior of the gross margin versus the cost of goods sold by province and type of dealer?
